What Are Digits and Numbers?
In this video, we learn about the ten digits and how to make numbers from these ten digits.  Using the ten digits, any number can be made. The number can be large or small. The place of each of the digits make a number.

Digits are like the building blocks of numbers. Just like how we use letters to make words, we use digits to make numbers. There are ten digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. By putting these digits together in different ways, we can make all the numbers in the world!

We use ten digits in our everday life to count. For example, we say 'I see 25 trees', or 'I have 37 marbles'. 
We also use digits and numbers to tell time. When you look at the clock, you see numbers that tell you what time it is. "It's 7 o'clock."

Even though hunans use 10 digits, computers only use two digits. Instead of using all ten digits, they only use two: 0 and 1. Everything you see on a computer screen, like games, videos, and pictures, is made up of lots and lots of 0s and 1s!

Hereâ€™s a fun fact: Your age is a number! Right now, you might be 6 years old, which is made up of the digit 6. Next year, you will be 7, and that's another digit. And guess what? You are getting older and adding more numbers to your age every year!

So, digits and numbers are everywhere around us, helping us do all sorts of things. They help us count, measure, and even run our favorite games and videos on computers. Isn't that amazing?
