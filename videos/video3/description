Lets learn about two very important math skills: **addition and subtraction**.

### Addition

Addition is like putting things together. When you add, you combine two or more numbers to find out how many you have in total.

#### How to Add:

1. **Count All Together:** If you have 3 bananas and someone gives you 2 more bananas, you count all the bananas together.
2. **Use the Plus Sign (+):** We use the plus sign (+) to show addition. For example, 3 + 2 means you are adding 3 and 2.
3. **Find the Total:** The total number of bananas is 5. So, 3 + 2 = 5.

#### Real-World Example:

Imagine you have 4 marbles and your friend gives you 3 more. How many marbles do you have now? You add them together: 4 + 3 = 7 marbles!

### Subtraction

Subtraction is like taking things away. When you subtract, you find out how many are left after you take some away.

#### How to Subtract:

1. **Take Some Away:** If you have 5 cookies and you eat 2 of them, you are taking away 2 cookies.
2. **Use the Minus Sign (-):** We use the minus sign (-) to show subtraction. For example, 5 - 2 means you are taking 2 away from 5.
3. **Find What’s Left:** The number of cookies left is 3. So, 5 - 2 = 3.

#### Real-World Example:

Imagine you have 6 balloons, but 2 of them fly away. How many balloons do you have now? You subtract to find out: 6 - 2 = 4 balloons!

### Practice Addition and Subtraction

1. **Addition Practice:**
   - Count your baloons and add more to see how many you have in total.
   - Use your fingers to add small numbers together.

2. **Subtraction Practice:**
   - Count your baloons and pop some away to see how many are left.

### Conclusion

Addition and subtraction are like magic tricks with numbers. Addition helps you find out how many you have in total when you put things together, and subtraction helps you find out how many are left when you take things away. With a little practice, you’ll be a math wizard in no time!

Thank you for listening and happy counting!
